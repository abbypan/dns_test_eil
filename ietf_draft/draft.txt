                      ISP Location in DNS Queries
                   draft-pan-dnsop-edns-isp-location

Abstract

   This document describes an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)
   option that is in active use to carry information about the network
   that originated a DNS query and the network for which the subsequent
   response can be cached.

   It is inspired by EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) with some privacy
   considerations, goals to reduce the "guess geolocation of client's
   IP" work on Authoritative Nameservers.

1.  Introduction

   As described in EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) [RFC7871], many
   Authoritative Nameservers today return different responses based on
   the perceived topological location of the user.  These servers use
   the IP address of the incoming query to identify that location.  ECS
   is an EDNS0 [RFC6891] option to carry client subnet information in
   dns queries for Authoritative Server.  Compared to source IP address
   of dns query, ECS will help Authoritative Server to guess the
   client's location more precisely because of the DNS forwarding query
   structure.

   However, ECS raises some privacy concerns because it leaks client
   subnet information on the resolution path to the Authoritative
   Server.

   Meanwhile, many Authoritative Nameservers support GeoIP Feature, for
   example, BIND-GeoIP [BIND-GeoIP], PowerDNS-GeoIP [PowerDNS-GeoIP],
   Amazon-Geolocation-Routing [Amazon-Geolocation-Routing], DYN-Traffic-
   Director-ECS [DYN-Traffic-Director-ECS], gdnsd-GeoIP [gdnsd-GeoIP],
   etc.  They guess the user's geolocation by the client subnet of ECS
   or by the source IP address of dns query, return tailor dns response
   based on the user's geolocation.  To sum up, these Authoritative
   Nameservers use ECS client subnet information for GeoIP Feature's
   user geolocation detecting.

   This document is an improved solution for ECS-enabled GeoIP Feature
   of Authoritative Server, describes an EDNS ISP Location (EIL)
   extension to address the privacy problem of ECS, find the right
   balance between privacy improvement and user experience optimization.
   EIL is defined to convey ISP location information that is relevant to
   the DNS message.  It will directly provide the same sufficient
   geolocation information for the GeoIP-based Authoritative Server that
   enabling ECS, to decide the response without guessing geolocation of
   the IP address.

   EIL is intended for those Local Forwarding Resolvers, Recursive
   Resolvers and Authoritative Servers that would benefit from the
   extension and not for general purpose deployment like ECS scenario.
   It could be applied for tailor dns response.  EIL can safely be
   ignored by servers that choose not to implement or enable it.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

3.  Terminology

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC7719] and [RFC7871].

   EIL: EDNS ISP Location.

   ECS: EDNS Client Subnet, described in [RFC7871].

   Local Forwarding Resolver: Forwarding Resolver is described in
   [RFC7871].  It is the first Forwarding Resolver which receives dns
   queries from Stub Resolver, usually deployed nearby the first-hop
   router such as public Wi-Fi hotspot routers and home routers.

   Recursive Resolver: described in [RFC7871].  It is the last-hop
   before Authoritative Server in the dns query path.

   Intermediate Nameserver: described in [RFC7871].  Any nameserver in
   between the Stub Resolver and the Authoritative Nameserver, such as a
   Recursive Resolver or a Forwarding Resolver.

   Intermediate Forwarding Resolver: Any Forwarding Resolver in between
   the Local Forwarding Resolver and Recursive Resolver.

   Authoritative Server: described in [RFC7719] and [RFC2182].  It is a
   server that knows the content of a DNS zone from local knowledge, and
   thus can answer queries about that zone without needing to query
   other servers.

4.  Overview

   This document provides an EDNS0 option to allow Local Forwarding
   Resolvers and Recursive Resolvers, if they are willing, to forward
   details about the isp location of client when talking to other
   nameservers.

   The format of EIL option is described in Section 5.  EIL can be added
   in queries sent by Local Forwarding Resolvers or Recursive Resolvers
   in a way that is transparent to Stub Resolvers and end users.  EIL is
   only defined for the Internet (IN) DNS class.

   Like ECS, Authoritative Servers could provide a better answer by
   using precise isp location in EIL.  Intermediate Nameservers could
   send EIL query and cache the EIL response.  This document also
   provides a mechanism to signal Intermediate Nameservers that they do
   not want EIL treatment for specific queries.

   The security concerns for EIL are like ECS, such as cache growth,
   spoof EDNS0 option and privacy, etc.  Mitigation techniques are
   discussed in Section 6.

5.  The EIL EDNS0 option

   The EIL is an EDNS0 option to include the isp location of client in
   DNS messages.

   It is 14 octets which is structured as follows:

                 +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    0: |                         OPTION-CODE                           |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    2: |                         OPTION-LENGTH                         |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    4: |                         COUNTRY-CODE                          |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    6: |                         AREA-CODE                             |
       |                                                               |
       |                                                               |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   12: |                         ISP                                   |
       |                                                               |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

       Total: 14 octets.

   o  OPTION-CODE, 2 octets, defined in [RFC6891].  EDNS option code
      should be assigned by the IANA.

   o  OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets, defined in [RFC6891], contains the length
      of the payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in octets.

   o  COUNTRY-CODE, 2 octets, upppercase, defined in [ISO3166],
      indicates the country information of the client's IP.  For
      example, China's COUNTRY-CODE is CN.

   o  AREA-CODE, 6 octets, uppercase, defined in [ISO3166] country
      subdivision code, indicates the area information of the client's
      IP.  For example, The AREA-CODE of Fujian Province in China is 35.

   o  ISP, 4 octets, uppercase, indicates the ISP information of the
      client's IP, using shortcut names.  ISP shortcut names are unique
      within the context of the COUNTRY-CODE.  For example, the shortcut
      name of China Telecommunications Corporation is TEL, the shortcut
      name of China United Network Communications is UNI, the shortcut
      name of China Mobile is MOB, etc.

   All fields are in network byte order ("big-endian", per [RFC1700],
   Data Notation).

   The aim to use short names in the fields is to limit the data size of
   EIL, decrease the DDoS risk.  The null value 0x20 signifies that the
   field is unknown.  If all fields in EIL are set to null value, it
   means that client doesn't want to use EIL.

6.  Protocol Description

6.1.  Originating the Option

   The EIL can be initialized by Public Recursive Resolver, ISP
   Recursive Resolver, or Local Forwarding Resolver.

6.1.1.  P-Model: Public Recursive Resolver

   When a public Recursive Resolver receives a DNS query, it can guess
   geolocation of client's IP and generate the EIL OPT data, then send
   EIL query to the Authoritative Server.  This will move the "guess
   geolocation of client's IP" work from Authoritative Server to Public
   Recursive Resolver, lighten the burden of Authoritative Server, but
   increase DDoS risk on Public Recursive Resolver.

   In order to improve the user's privacy, if a Recursive Resolver
   receives a dns query with ECS, it can guess the isp location of
   SOURCE-PREFIX from the ECS OPT data, and make a new dns query with
   EIL, then send the query to Authoritative Server which supports EIL.

   P-model is the most recommended and close to the ECS.

6.1.2.  I-Model: ISP Recursive Resolver

   ISP Recursive Resolver only serves its customers, each of whom has a
   static geolocation.  ISP Recursive Resolver can add EIL transparent
   to end user, and then Authoritative Server doesn't need to "guess
   geolocation of client's IP".

   EIL will be benefit if the Authoritative Server could not find the
   approximate geolocation of ISP Recursive Resolver, which is crucial
   to DNS response accuracy in ECS.

6.1.3.  L-Model: Local Forwarding Resolver

   Local Forwarding Resolver is usually on the first-hop router, such as
   public Wi-Fi hotspot routers and Cisco/Linksys/Netgear/TP-LINK home
   routers.

   When a Local Forwarding Resolver that implements EIL receives a DNS
   query from an end user, it surely can know about the geolocation
   information of client's IP, and generate the EIL OPT data, then send
   the EIL query to the intermediate Recursive Resolver.  Intermediate
   Recursive Resolver sends the EIL query to the Authoritative Server.

   In this scenario, both public Recursive Resolver and Authoritative
   Server don't need to "guess geolocation of client's IP", because the
   Local Forwarding Resolver supplies the geolocation precisely.  That
   is, EIL can reduce dependence on the IP geolocation database quality,
   which is crucial to DNS response accuracy in ECS.

   If a Local Fowarding Resolver had sent a query with EIL, and recieves
   a REFUSE response, it MUST regenerate a query with no EIL.

6.2.  Generating a Response

6.2.1.  Whitelist

   EIL contains a whitelist for COUNTRY-CODE, AREA-CODE and ISP, which
   can be discussed or maintained by the DNSOP working group.
   Authoritative Servers that supporting EIL must only response the EIL
   queries matched the whitelist.  Recursive Resolver that supporting
   EIL must only cache the EIL responses matched the whitelist.

6.2.2.  Authoritative Server

   Using the isp location specified in the EIL option of dns query, an
   Authoritative Server can generate a tailored response.

   Authoritative Servers that have not implemented or enabled support
   for the EIL ought to safely ignore it within incoming queries,
   response the query as a normal case without EDNS0 option.  Such a
   server MUST NOT include an EIL option within replies to indicate lack
   of support for it.

   An Authoritative Server that has implemented this protocol and
   receives an EIL option MUST include an EIL option in its response to
   indicate that it SHOULD be cached accordingly.

   An Authoritative Server will return a more appropriate tailored
   response for the query with an EIL option containing more pricisely
   AREA-CODE.

6.2.3.  Intermediate Nameserver

   Like ECS, Intermediate Nameserver passes a dns response with an EIL
   option to its client when the client indicates support EIL.

   If an Intermediate Nameserver receives a response that has a larger
   area than the AREA-CODE provided in its query, it SHOULD still
   provide the result as the answer to the triggering client request
   even if the client is in a smaller area.

6.3.  Handling EIL Responses and Caching

   If an Intermediate Nameserver had sent a query with EIL, and receives
   a NOERROR response without EIL option, it SHOULD treat this answer as
   suitable for all clients.

   Other handling considerations are similar with ECS, SECTION 7.3.

6.3.1.  Caching the Response

   In the cache, all resource records in the Answer section MUST be tied
   to the isp location specified in the response.  The Answer seciton is
   valid for all areas which the EIL option covered.  For example, an
   EIL option { "COUNTRY-CODE": "CN", "AREA-CODE": "35", "ISP": "TEL" }
   covers all 9 Cities in FuJian Province of China Telecommunications
   ISP.

   Same with ECS, The Additional and Authority sections are excluded.

   Enabling support for EIL in an Intermediate Nameserver will increase
   the size of the cache, and prevent "client subnet leak" privacy
   concern of ECS.

6.3.2.  Answering from Cache

   Cache lookups are first done as usual for a DNS query, using the
   query tuple of < name, type, class >.  Then, the appropriate RRset
   MUST be chosen based on the isp location matching.

   If there was an EIL option, the Intermediate Nameserver will lookup
   for < same COUNTRY-CODE, same ISP, same AREA-CODE > of the same query
   tuple in the cache.  Otherwise, try to find < same COUNTRY-CODE, same
   ISP, same AREA-CODE > of the same query tuple in the cache.

   If no EIL option was provided, the safest choice of the Intermediate
   Nameserver is dealing the query as a normal case without EDNS0
   option.

   If no EIL option was provided, but the Intermediate Nameserver want
   to be more aggressive, it can guess the isp location from the souce
   IP of the query, then respond as if there was an EIL option with the
   guessed information.  Users can be benefit when the Intermediate
   Nameserver has a more precise IP location database than the
   Authoritative Server, especially in global public DNS service like
   GoogleDNS(8.8.8.8).

   If no matching is found, the Intermediate Nameserver MUST perform
   resolution as usual.

6.3.3.  Support ECS and EIL at the same time

   Name servers can support ECS and EIL at the same time.  ECS and EIL
   can't be both initiated at the same dns packet.  It is better for
   user privacy if name servers initiate the EIL query prior to the ECS
   query.

   If Authoritative servers support both ECS and EIL, Recursive
   resolvers can cache both ECS response and EIL response, there are
   some choices for Recursive Resolvers when they receive dns queries.

 Receive EIL query:
     Search in EIL cache.
     If cache is matched, return EIL response.
     Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Server.

 Receive ECS query:
     Search in ECS cache.
     If cache is matched, return ECS response.
     Otherwise, send ECS query to Authoritative Server.

 Receive DNS query without EDNS option:
     Search in ECS cache.
     If cache is matched, return ECS response.
     Otherwise,
         Guess the geolocation information of the client's IP,
         build EIL option for the query packet.
         Search in EIL cache.
         If cache is matched, return EIL response.
         Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Server.

 Receive DNS query with not-ECS/not-EIL option:
     Search in not-EDNS cache.
     If cache is matched, return response.
     Otherwise, send the DNS query to Authoritative Server.

 Receive ECS query, improve user privacy:
     Guess the geolocation information of the client's IP,
     build EIL option for the query packet.
     Search in EIL cache.
     If cache is matched, return EIL response RR with origin ECS option.
     Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Server.

6.4.  Delegations and Negative Answers

   EIL's delegation case is similar with ECS, Additional and Authority
   Sections SHOULD ignore EIL.

   For negative answers, Authoritative Servers return traditional
   negative answers without EIL.

6.5.  Transitivity

   EIL's transitivity concerns are similar with ECS.

   Name servers should only enable EIL where it is expected to benefit
   the end users, such as dealing with some latency-sensitive CDN domain
   queries in a complex network environment.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  DNSSEC

   EIL is not signed.

7.2.  Privacy

   The biggest privacy concern on ECS is that client subnet information
   is personally identifiable.  The more domains publish their zones on
   a third-party Authoritative Server, the more end user privacy
   information can be gathered by the Authoritative Server according to
   the ECS queries.

   EIL is to improve user privacy which is inspired by ECS, prevented
   leaks in the client subnet information.

   Like ECS, EIL will leak the global zonefile configurations of the
   Authoritative Servers more easily than normal case.

7.3.  Target Censorship

   DNS traffic is plain text by default.  It is easily to be blocked or
   poisoned by internet target censorship.  To bypass the censorship, it
   is better to encrypt the dns traffic or use some proxy tunnel.

   EIL's geolocation information covers bigger area than ECS's client
   subnet information.  Therefore, compared to ECS in plain text
   condition, EIL is weaker at blocking record attack, but stronger at
   targeted DNS poisoning attack.

7.4.  Cache Size

   Like ECS, cache size will raise if a public recursive resolver
   supports EIL.  The cache size of ECS grows up with the number of
   client subnets.  The cache size of EIL is related to the row count in
   the < COUNTRY-CODE, AREA-CODE, ISP > geolocation whitelist.
   Therefore, under IPv6 environment, the cache size of EIL will be
   smaller than ECS.

7.5.  DDoS

   To migrate the DDoS problem:

   o  If an Authority Server receives a dns query with unknown data in
      EIL option, it SHOULD return the default response whose EIL option
      with null value.

   o  Nameservers OPTIONAL only implement EIL when the query is from a
      TCP connection.

   More migration techniques described in [RFC7871], Section 11.3.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines EIL, need request IANA to assign a new EDNS0
   option code to EIL.

9.  Acknowledgements

   EIL is inspired by ECS, the authors especially thanks to C.
   Contavalli, W. van der Gaast, D.  Lawrence, and W.  Kumari.

   Thanks a lot to all in the DNSOP, DNSPRIV and DNSEXT mailing list.

10.  Appendix A.  Example

   Authoritative Server of www.example.com has enabled EIL.

   Stub DNS query A resource record of www.example.com .

10.1.  Example 1: P-Model

   Stub DNS -> Local Forwarding Resolver (61.48.7.2) -> Public
   Forwarding Resolver(AliDNS, 223.5.5.5) -> Public Recursive
   Resolver(AliDNS, 202.108.250.231) -> Authoritative Server

   Public Forwarding Resolver 223.5.5.5 could enable EIL and generate
   the EIL OPT data { "COUNTRY-CODE": "CN", "AREA-CODE": "11", "ISP":
   "UNI" } based on 61.48.7.2.

   P-Model will not leak client subnet to Authoritative Server.

10.2.  Example 2: I-Model

   Stub DNS -> Local Forwarding Resolver -> ISP Forwarding
   Resolver(202.106.196.115) -> ISP Recursive Resolver(61.135.23.92) ->
   Authoritative Server

   ISP Recursive Resolver 61.135.23.92 could enable EIL and generate the
   EIL OPT data { "COUNTRY-CODE": "CN", "AREA-CODE": "11", "ISP": "UNI"
   } based on 61.135.23.92.

   If Authoritative Server doesn't know much about 61.135.23.92, EIL
   will be helpful.

10.3.  Example 3: L-Model

   Stub DNS -> Local Fowarding Resolver(58.60.109.234) -> ...  ->
   Authoritative Server

   Local Fowarding Resolver 58.60.109.234 could enable EIL and generate
   the option data is { "COUNTRY-CODE": "CN", "AREA-CODE": "44", "ISP":
   "TEL" } based on 58.60.109.234.

   L-Model can give the most precisely isp location information for dns
   resolution.
