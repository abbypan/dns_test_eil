                      ISP Location in DNS Queries
                  draft-pan-dnsop-edns-isp-location-01

Abstract

   This document describes an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)
   option that is in active use to carry < COUNTRY, AREA, ISP > isp
   location information about the network that originated a DNS query
   and the network for which the subsequent response can be cached.

   It is inspired by EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) with some privacy
   considerations, goals to reduce the "guess location of client's IP"
   work on Authoritative Nameservers.

Internet-Draft         ISP Location in DNS Queries              May 2017


1.  Introduction

   As described in EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) [RFC7871], many
   Authoritative Nameservers today return different responses based on
   the perceived topological location of the user.  These servers use
   the IP address of the incoming query to identify that location.  ECS
   is an EDNS0 [RFC6891] option to carry client subnet information in
   DNS queries for Authoritative Nameserver.  Compared to source IP
   address of DNS query, ECS will help Authoritative Nameserver to guess
   the client's location more precisely because of the DNS forwarding
   query structure.

   However, ECS raises some privacy concerns because it leaks client
   subnet information on the resolution path to the Authoritative
   Nameserver.

   Meanwhile, many Authoritative Nameservers support GeoIP feature, for
   example, BIND-GeoIP [BIND-GeoIP], PowerDNS-GeoIP [PowerDNS-GeoIP],
   Amazon-Geolocation-Routing [Amazon-Geolocation-Routing], DYN-Traffic-
   Director-ECS [DYN-Traffic-Director-ECS], gdnsd-GeoIP [gdnsd-GeoIP],
   etc.  These geographically aware Authoritative Nameservers guess the
   user's geolocation by the client subnet of ECS or by the source IP
   address of DNS query, return tailor DNS response based on the user's
   geolocation.  To sum up, these Authoritative Nameservers use ECS
   client subnet information for GeoIP feature's user geolocation
   detecting.

   This document is an improved solution for ECS-enabled GeoIP feature
   of Authoritative Nameserver, describes an EDNS ISP Location (EIL)
   extension to address the privacy problem of ECS, find the right
   balance between privacy improvement and user experience optimization.
   EIL is defined to convey isp location < COUNTRY, AREA, ISP >
   information that is relevant to the DNS message.  It will directly
   provide the same sufficient information for the GeoIP-based
   Authoritative Nameserver that enabling ECS, to decide the response
   without guessing geolocation of the IP address.

   EIL is intended for those Local Forwarding Resolvers, Recursive
   Resolvers and Authoritative Nameservers that would benefit from the
   extension and not for general purpose deployment like ECS scenario.
   It could be applied for tailor DNS response.  EIL can safely be
   ignored by servers that choose not to implement or enable it.

1.1.  Path Calculation and Tailored DNS Response

   Separate the consideration of path calculation (Data Provider) and
   tailored DNS response (Authoritative Nameserver).

Internet-Draft         ISP Location in DNS Queries              May 2017


   Data Providers make path calculations to optimize content delivery on
   the Internet based on the network topology, considering many factors
   such as IP, RIPs, FIBs, AS Path hops, system load, content
   availability, path latency, etc.  Note that, Data Providers have the
   full details of the clients, they can make any complex path
   calculations without ECS and EIL.

   Authoritative Nameservers configure tailored DNS response based on
   the result of path calculations, allocate IP addresses to different
   datacenters.  Usually, users from the same < COUNTRY, AREA, ISP > isp
   location are allocated to the same datacenter, the same best "network
   topologically close" datacenter.  For example, client IP addresses
   from < China, Beijing, Telecom > are allocated to DataCenter-1,
   client IP addresses from < China, Beijing, Unicom > are allocated to
   DataCenter-2, etc.  Above is the GeoIP-based Tailored DNS Response.

   Therefore, if the GeoIP-based Authoritative Nameservers enable ECS,
   they can use the client subnet information of ECS instead of
   resolver's address for GeoIP detecting.  Moreover, the GeoIP-based
   Authoritative Nameservers can directly use the < COUNTRY, AREA, ISP >
   information of EIL without GeoIP detecting.

   Again, we emphasize that tailored DNS response does not affect path
   calculation.  Data Providers can make path calculations based on
   network topology, decide network topological close datacenter for
   each IP address.  Authoritative Nameservers allocate tailored DNS
   response to each IP address based on the "network topological close"
   result of path calculations.  EIL tell Authoritative Nameserver like
   that, "I want to know what is best IP address for clients from <
   China, Beijing, Telecom > at network topology path calculations
   result", but not "I want to know what is the nearest IP address for
   clients from < China, Beijing, Telecom > at physical topology path
   calculations result".

   EIL is satisfied if Authoritative Nameservers aggregate the IP
   addresses from the same < COUNTRY, AREA, ISP > isp location to visit
   the same datacenters, we call that GeoIP-based tailored DNS
   responses, and these tailored responses have "network topological
   close" distance to the users.

   ECS is satisfied if Authoritative Nameservers make tailored DNS
   response down to subnet precise level.  For example, (subnet-1, ...,
   subnet-100) are from the same < COUNTRY, AREA, ISP > isp location,
   Data Provider applies (subnet-1, ..., subnet-50) visit DataCenter-1,
   (subnet-51, ..., subnet-100) visit DataCenter-2.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119]
   keywords.

3.  Terminology

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC7719] and [RFC7871].

   EIL: EDNS ISP Location.

   ECS: EDNS Client Subnet, described in [RFC7871].

   Local Forwarding Resolver: Forwarding Resolver is described in
   [RFC7871].  It is the first Forwarding Resolver which receives DNS
   queries from Stub Resolver, usually deployed nearby the first-hop
   router such as public Wi-Fi hotspot routers and home routers.

   Recursive Resolver: described in [RFC7871].  It is the last-hop
   before Authoritative Nameserver in the DNS query path.

   Intermediate Nameserver: described in [RFC7871].  Any nameserver in
   between the Stub Resolver and the Authoritative Nameserver, such as a
   Recursive Resolver or a Forwarding Resolver.

   Intermediate Forwarding Resolver: Any Forwarding Resolver in between
   the Local Forwarding Resolver and Recursive Resolver.

   Authoritative Nameserver: described in [RFC7719] and [RFC2182].  It
   is a server that knows the content of a DNS zone from local
   knowledge, and thus can answer queries about that zone without
   needing to query other servers.

4.  Overview

   This document provides an EDNS0 option to allow Local Forwarding
   Resolvers and Recursive Resolvers, if they are willing, to forward
   details about the isp location of client when talking to other
   nameservers.

   The format of EIL option is described in Section 5.  EIL can be added
   in queries sent by Local Forwarding Resolvers or Recursive Resolvers

   in a way that is transparent to Stub Resolvers and end users.  EIL is
   only defined for the Internet (IN) DNS class.

   Like ECS, Authoritative Nameservers could provide a better answer by
   using precise isp location in EIL.  Intermediate Nameservers could
   send EIL query and cache the EIL response.  This document also
   provides a mechanism to signal Intermediate Nameservers that they do
   not want EIL treatment for specific queries.

   The security concerns for EIL are like ECS, such as cache growth,
   spoof EDNS0 option and privacy, etc.  Mitigation techniques are
   discussed in Section 6.

5.  The EIL EDNS0 option

   The EIL is an EDNS0 option to include the isp location of client in
   DNS messages.

   It is 14 octets which is structured as follows:

                 +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    0: |                         OPTION-CODE                           |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    2: |                         OPTION-LENGTH                         |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    4: |                         COUNTRY-CODE                          |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    6: |                         AREA-CODE                             |
       |                                                               |
       |                                                               |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   12: |                         ISP                                   |
       |                                                               |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

       Total: 14 octets.

   o  OPTION-CODE, 2 octets, defined in [RFC6891].  EDNS option code
      should be assigned by the IANA.

   o  OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets, defined in [RFC6891], contains the length
      of the payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in octets.

   o  COUNTRY-CODE, 2 octets, uppercase, defined in [ISO3166], indicates
      the country information of the client's IP.  For example, China's
      COUNTRY-CODE is CN.

Internet-Draft         ISP Location in DNS Queries              May 2017


   o  AREA-CODE, 6 octets, uppercase, defined in [ISO3166] country
      subdivision code, indicates the area information of the client's
      IP.  For example, The AREA-CODE of Fujian Province in China is 35.

   o  ISP, 4 octets, uppercase, indicates the ISP information of the
      client's IP, using shortcut names.  ISP shortcut names are unique
      within the context of the COUNTRY-CODE.  For example, the shortcut
      name of China Telecommunications Corporation is TEL, the shortcut
      name of China United Network Communications is UNI, the shortcut
      name of China Mobile is MOB, etc.

   All fields are in network byte order ("big-endian", per [RFC1700],
   Data Notation).

   The aim to use short names in the fields is to limit the data size of
   EIL, decrease the DDoS risk.

   The null value 0x20 signifies that the field is unknown.  If all
   fields in EIL are set to null value, it means that client doesn't
   want to use EIL.

   Authoritative Nameservers can send EIL response with the * value 0x2A
   in AREA-CODE field or ISP field (not COUNTRY-CODE field), which
   signifies that the field is wildcard match.  For example, < CN, *,
   TEL > indicates: all area in China, Telecom ISP.

   Example code is in Github at: https://github.com/abbypan/dns_test_eil
   .

6.  Protocol Description

6.1.  Originating the Option

   The EIL can be initialized by Public Recursive Resolver, ISP
   Recursive Resolver, or Local Forwarding Resolver.

6.1.1.  P-Model: Public Recursive Resolver

   Public Recursive Resolvers are not close to many users because the
   service providers couldn't deploy servers in every country and every
   ISP's network, which will affect the response accuracy of
   Authoritative Nameservers.  To encounter this problem, ECS shifts the
   client subnet information to Authoritative Nameserver, but rises user
   privacy concerns.

   Therefore, to keep balance between precise and privacy, when a Public
   Recursive Resolver receives a DNS query, it can guess isp location of
   client's IP and generate the EIL OPT data, then send EIL query to the

Internet-Draft         ISP Location in DNS Queries              May 2017


   Authoritative Nameserver.  This will move the "guess location of
   client's IP" work from Authoritative Nameserver back to Public
   Recursive Resolver, lighten the burden of Authoritative Nameserver,
   but increase DDoS risk on Public Recursive Resolver.

   In order to improve the user's privacy, if a Recursive Resolver
   receives a DNS query with ECS, it can guess the isp location of
   SOURCE-PREFIX from the ECS OPT data, and make a new DNS query with
   EIL, then send the query to Authoritative Nameserver which supports
   EIL.

   P-model is the most recommended and close to the ECS.

6.1.2.  I-Model: ISP Recursive Resolver

   ISP Recursive Resolver only serves its customers, each of whom has a
   static isp location.  ISP Recursive Resolver can add EIL transparent
   to end user, and then Authoritative Nameserver doesn't need to "guess
   location of client's IP".

   EIL will be benefit if the Authoritative Nameserver could not find
   the approximate isp location of ISP Recursive Resolver, which is
   crucial to DNS response accuracy in ECS.

6.1.3.  L-Model: Local Forwarding Resolver

   Local Forwarding Resolver is usually on the first-hop router, such as
   public Wi-Fi hotspot routers and Cisco/Linksys/Netgear/TP-LINK home
   routers.

   When a Local Forwarding Resolver that implements EIL receives a DNS
   query from an end user, it surely can know about the isp location of
   client's IP, and generate the EIL OPT data, then send the EIL query
   to the intermediate Recursive Resolver.  Intermediate Recursive
   Resolver sends the EIL query to the Authoritative Nameserver.

   In this scenario, both Public Recursive Resolver and Authoritative
   Nameserver don't need to "guess location of client's IP", because the
   Local Forwarding Resolver supplies the isp location precisely.  That
   is, EIL can reduce dependence on the IP geolocation database quality,
   which is crucial to DNS response accuracy in ECS.

   If a Local Forwarding Resolver had sent a query with EIL, and
   receives a REFUSE response, it MUST regenerate a query with no EIL.

Internet-Draft         ISP Location in DNS Queries              May 2017


6.2.  Generating a Response

6.2.1.  Whitelist

   EIL contains a whitelist for COUNTRY-CODE, AREA-CODE and ISP, which
   can be discussed or maintained by the DNSOP working group.
   Authoritative Nameservers that supporting EIL must only response the
   EIL queries matched the whitelist.  Recursive Resolver that
   supporting EIL must only cache the EIL responses matched the
   whitelist.

6.2.2.  Authoritative Nameserver

   Using the isp location specified in the EIL option of DNS query, an
   Authoritative Nameserver can generate a tailored response.

   Authoritative Nameservers that have not implemented or enabled
   support for the EIL ought to safely ignore it within incoming
   queries, response the query as a normal case without EDNS0 option.
   Such a server MUST NOT include an EIL option within replies to
   indicate lack of support for it.

   An Authoritative Nameserver that has implemented this protocol and
   receives an EIL option MUST include an EIL option in its response to
   indicate that it SHOULD be cached accordingly.

   An Authoritative Nameserver will return a more appropriate tailored
   response for the query with an EIL option containing more precisely
   AREA-CODE.

6.2.3.  Intermediate Nameserver

   Like ECS, Intermediate Nameserver passes a DNS response with an EIL
   option to its client when the client indicates support EIL.

   If an Intermediate Nameserver receives a response that has a larger
   area than the AREA-CODE provided in its query, it SHOULD still
   provide the result as the answer to the triggering client request
   even if the client is in a smaller area.

6.3.  Handling EIL Responses and Caching

   If an Intermediate Nameserver had sent a query with EIL, and receives
   a NOERROR response without EIL option, it SHOULD treat this answer as
   suitable for all clients.

   Other handling considerations are similar with ECS [RFC7871], SECTION
   7.3.

Internet-Draft         ISP Location in DNS Queries              May 2017


6.3.1.  Caching the Response

   In the cache, all resource records in the Answer section MUST be tied
   to the isp location specified in the response.  The Answer section is
   valid for all areas which the EIL option covered.  For example, an
   EIL option < CN, 35, TEL > covers all 9 Cities in Fujian Province of
   China Telecommunications ISP.

   Same with ECS, The Additional and Authority sections are excluded.

   Enabling support for EIL in an Intermediate Nameserver will increase
   the size of the cache, and prevent "client subnet leak" privacy
   concern of ECS.

6.3.2.  Answering from Cache

   Cache lookups are first done as usual for a DNS query, using the
   query tuple of < name, type, class >.  Then, the appropriate RRset
   MUST be chosen based on the isp location matching.

   If there was an EIL option, the Intermediate Nameserver will lookup
   for < same COUNTRY-CODE, same ISP, same AREA-CODE > of the same query
   tuple in the cache.  Otherwise, try to find < same COUNTRY-CODE, same
   ISP, same AREA-CODE > of the same query tuple in the cache.

   If no EIL option was provided, the safest choice of the Intermediate
   Nameserver is dealing the query as a normal case without EDNS0
   option.

   If no EIL option was provided, but the Intermediate Nameserver want
   to be more aggressive, it can guess the isp location from the source
   IP of the query, then respond as if there was an EIL option with the
   guessed information.  Users can be benefit when the Intermediate
   Nameserver has a more precise IP location database than the
   Authoritative Nameserver, especially in global public DNS service
   like GoogleDNS(8.8.8.8).

   If no matching is found, the Intermediate Nameserver MUST perform
   resolution as usual.

6.3.3.  Support ECS and EIL at the same time

   Name servers can support ECS and EIL at the same time.  ECS and EIL
   can't be both initiated at the same DNS packet.  It is better for
   user privacy if name servers initiate the EIL query prior to the ECS
   query.

   If Authoritative Nameservers support both ECS and EIL, Recursive
   resolvers can cache both ECS response and EIL response, there are
   some choices for Recursive Resolvers when they receive DNS queries.

 Receive EIL query:
     Search in EIL cache.
     If cache is matched, return EIL response.
     Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Nameserver.

 Receive ECS query:
     Search in ECS cache.
     If cache is matched, return ECS response.
     Otherwise, send ECS query to Authoritative Nameserver.

 Receive DNS query without EDNS option:
     Search in ECS cache.
     If cache is matched, return ECS response.
     Otherwise,
         Guess the isp location information of the client's IP,
         build EIL option for the query packet.
         Search in EIL cache.
         If cache is matched, return EIL response.
         Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Nameserver.

 Receive DNS query with not-ECS/not-EIL option:
     Search in not-EDNS cache.
     If cache is matched, return response.
     Otherwise, send the DNS query to Authoritative Nameserver.

 Receive ECS query, improve user privacy:
     Guess the isp location information of the client's IP,
     build EIL option for the query packet.
     Search in EIL cache.
     If cache is matched, return EIL response RR with origin ECS option.
     Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Nameserver.

6.4.  Delegations and Negative Answers

   EIL's delegation case is similar with ECS, Additional and Authority
   Sections SHOULD ignore EIL.

   For negative answers, Authoritative Nameservers return traditional
   negative answers without EIL.

6.5.  Transitivity

   EIL's transitivity concerns are similar with ECS.

   Name servers should only enable EIL where it is expected to benefit
   the end users, such as dealing with some latency-sensitive CDN domain
   queries in a complex network environment.

6.6.  Response Accuracy

   Authoritative Nameservers that support ECS-enabled GeoIP feature can
   support EIL smoothly.

   Compared to ECS, EIL can reduce dependence on the IP geolocation
   database quality.  EIL will rise the response accuracy of
   Authoritative Nameserver if its database can not find approximate isp
   location of ECS client subnet, ensure user latency.  EIL will help
   Authoritative Nameservers to avoid cross-isp visit if its database
   can not find approximate isp location of ECS client subnet, save IP
   transit cost.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  DNSSEC

   EIL is not signed.

7.2.  Privacy

   As mentioned in [RFC7871]'s abstract section, since ECS has some
   known operational and privacy shortcomings, a revision will be worked
   through the IETF for improvement.  The biggest privacy concern on ECS
   is that client subnet information is personally identifiable.  The
   more domains publish their zones on a third-party Authoritative
   Nameserver, the more end user privacy information can be gathered by
   the Authoritative Nameserver according to the ECS queries.

   EIL is to improve user privacy which is inspired by ECS, prevented
   leaks in the client subnet information.

   Like ECS, EIL will leak the global zonefile configurations of the
   Authoritative Nameservers more easily than normal case.

7.3.  Target Censorship

   DNS traffic is plain text by default.  It is easily to be blocked or
   poisoned by internet target censorship.  To bypass the censorship, it
   is better to encrypt the DNS traffic or use some proxy tunnel.

Internet-Draft         ISP Location in DNS Queries              May 2017


   EIL's isp location information covers bigger area than ECS's client
   subnet information.  Therefore, compared to ECS in plain text
   condition, EIL is weaker at blocking record attack, but stronger at
   targeted DNS poisoning attack.

7.4.  Cache Size

   Like ECS, cache size will raise if a Public Recursive Resolver
   supports EIL.  The cache size of ECS grows up with the number of
   client subnets.  The cache size of EIL is related to the row count in
   the < COUNTRY-CODE, AREA-CODE, ISP > isp location whitelist.
   Therefore, under IPv6 environment, the cache size of EIL will be
   smaller than ECS.

7.5.  DDoS

   To migrate the DDoS problem:

   o  If an Authority Server receives a DNS query with unknown data in
      EIL option, it SHOULD return the default response whose EIL option
      with null value.

   o  Nameservers OPTIONAL only implement EIL when the query is from a
      TCP connection.

   More migration techniques described in [RFC7871], Section 11.3.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines EIL, need request IANA to assign a new EDNS0
   option code to EIL.

9.  Acknowledgements

10.1.  Example 1: P-Model

   Stub DNS
   -> Local Forwarding Resolver (61.48.7.2)
   -> Public Forwarding Resolver(AliDNS, 223.5.5.5)
   -> Public Recursive Resolver(AliDNS, 202.108.250.231)
   -> Authoritative Nameserver

   Public Forwarding Resolver 223.5.5.5 could enable EIL and generate
   the EIL OPT data < CN, 11, UNI > based on 61.48.7.2.

   P-Model will not leak client subnet to Authoritative Nameserver.

10.2.  Example 2: I-Model

   Stub DNS
   -> Local Forwarding Resolver
   -> ISP Forwarding Resolver(202.106.196.115)
   -> ISP Recursive Resolver(61.135.23.92)
   -> Authoritative Nameserver

   ISP Recursive Resolver 61.135.23.92 could enable EIL and generate the
   EIL OPT data < CN, 11, UNI > based on 61.135.23.92.

   If Authoritative Nameserver doesn't know much about 61.135.23.92, EIL
   will be helpful.

10.3.  Example 3: L-Model

   Stub DNS
   -> Local Fowarding Resolver(58.60.109.234)
   -> ...
   -> Authoritative Nameserver

   Local Fowarding Resolver 58.60.109.234 could enable EIL and generate
   the option data is < CN, 44, TEL > based on 58.60.109.234.

   L-Model can give the most precisely isp location information for DNS
   resolution.
