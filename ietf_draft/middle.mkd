As described in [EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)](#RFC7871), many Authoritative Nameservers today return different responses based on the perceived topological location of the user.
These servers use the IP address of the incoming query to identify that location.
ECS is an [EDNS0](#RFC6891) option to carry client subnet information in dns queries for Authoritative Server.
Compared to source IP address of dns query, ECS will help Authoritative Server to guess the client's location more precisely because of the DNS forwarding query structure.

However, ECS raises some privacy concerns because it leaks client subnet information on the resolution path to the Authoritative Server.

Meanwhile, many Authoritative Nameservers support GeoIP Feature, for example, [BIND-GeoIP](#BIND-GeoIP), [PowerDNS-GeoIP](#PowerDNS-GeoIP), [Amazon-Geolocation-Routing](#Amazon-Geolocation-Routing), [DYN-Traffic-Director-ECS](#DYN-Traffic-Director-ECS), [gdnsd-GeoIP](#gdnsd-GeoIP), etc.
They guess the user's geolocation by the client subnet of ECS or by the source IP address of dns query, return tailor dns response based on the user's geolocation.
To sum up, these Authoritative Nameservers use ECS client subnet information for GeoIP Feature's user geolocation detecting.

This document is an improved solution for ECS-enabled GeoIP Feature of Authoritative Server, describes an EDNS ISP Location (EIL) extension to address the privacy problem of ECS, find the right balance between privacy improvement and user experience optimization.
EIL is defined to convey ISP location information that is relevant to the DNS message.
It will directly provide the same sufficient geolocation information for the GeoIP-based Authoritative Server that enabling ECS, to decide the response without guessing geolocation of the IP address.

EIL is intended for those Local Forwarding Resolvers, Recursive Resolvers and Authoritative Servers that would benefit from the extension and not for general purpose deployment like ECS scenario.
It could be applied for tailor dns response.
EIL can safely be ignored by servers that choose not to implement or enable it.

# Terminology

Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents [](#RFC1034), [](#RFC1035), [](#RFC7719) and [](#RFC7871).

EIL:  EDNS ISP Location.

ECS:  EDNS Client Subnet, described in [](#RFC7871).

Local Forwarding Resolver: Forwarding Resolver is described in [](#RFC7871). It is the first Forwarding Resolver which receives dns queries from Stub Resolver, usually deployed nearby the first-hop router such as public Wi-Fi hotspot routers and home routers.

Recursive Resolver: described in [](#RFC7871). It is the last-hop before Authoritative Server in the dns query path.

Intermediate Nameserver:  described in [](#RFC7871). Any nameserver in between the Stub Resolver and the Authoritative Nameserver, such as a Recursive Resolver or a Forwarding Resolver.

Intermediate Forwarding Resolver: Any Forwarding Resolver in between the Local Forwarding Resolver and Recursive Resolver.

Authoritative Server: described in [](#RFC7719) and [](#RFC2182). It is a server that knows the content of a DNS zone from local knowledge, and thus can answer queries about that zone without needing to query other servers.

# Overview

This document provides an EDNS0 option to allow Local Forwarding Resolvers and Recursive Resolvers, if they are willing, to forward details about the isp location of client when talking to other nameservers.

The format of EIL option is described in Section 5. EIL can be added in queries sent by Local Forwarding Resolvers or Recursive Resolvers in a way that is transparent to Stub Resolvers and end users. EIL is only defined for the Internet (IN) DNS class.

Like ECS, Authoritative Servers could provide a better answer by using precise isp location in EIL.
Intermediate Nameservers could send EIL query and cache the EIL response.
This document also provides a mechanism to signal Intermediate Nameservers that they do not want EIL treatment for specific queries.

The security concerns for EIL are like ECS, such as cache growth,
spoof EDNS0 option and privacy, etc.  Mitigation techniques are
discussed in Section 6.

# The EIL EDNS0 option

The EIL is an EDNS0 option to include the isp location of client in
DNS messages.

It is 14 octets which is structured as follows:

                    +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       0: |                         OPTION-CODE                           |
          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       2: |                         OPTION-LENGTH                         |
          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       4: |                         COUNTRY-CODE                          |
          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       6: |                         AREA-CODE                             |
          |                                                               |
          |                                                               |
          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      12: |                         ISP                                   |
          |                                                               |
          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

          Total: 14 octets.

   *  OPTION-CODE, 2 octets, defined in [](#RFC6891). EDNS option code should be assigned by the IANA.

   *  OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets, defined in [](#RFC6891), contains the length of the payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in octets.

   *  COUNTRY-CODE, 2 octets, upppercase, defined in [](#ISO3166), indicates the country information of the client’s IP. For example, China's COUNTRY-CODE is CN.

   *  AREA-CODE, 6 octets, uppercase, defined in [](#ISO3166) country subdivision code, indicates the area information of the client’s IP. For example, The AREA-CODE of Fujian Province in China is 35.

   *  ISP, 4 octets, uppercase, indicates the ISP information of the client’s IP, using shortcut names. ISP shortcut names are unique within the context of the COUNTRY-CODE. For example, the shortcut name of China Telecommunications Corporation is TEL, the shortcut name of China United Network Communications is UNI, the shortcut name of China Mobile is MOB, etc.

All fields are in network byte order ("big-endian", per [](#RFC1700),
Data Notation).

The aim to use short names in the fields is to limit the data size of
EIL, decrease the DDoS risk.  The null value 0x20 signifies that the
field is unknown.  If all fields in EIL are set to null value, it
means that client doesn't want to use EIL.

# Protocol Description

## Originating the Option

The EIL can be initialized by Public Recursive Resolver, ISP
Recursive Resolver, or Local Forwarding Resolver.

### P-Model: Public Recursive Resolver

When a public Recursive Resolver receives a DNS query, it can guess geolocation of client's IP and generate the EIL OPT data, 
then send EIL query to the Authoritative Server.
This will move the "guess geolocation of client’s IP" work from Authoritative Server to Public Recursive Resolver, lighten the burden of Authoritative Server, but increase DDoS risk on Public Recursive Resolver.

In order to improve the user's privacy, if a Recursive Resolver
receives a dns query with ECS, it can guess the isp location of
SOURCE-PREFIX from the ECS OPT data, and make a new dns query with
EIL, then send the query to Authoritative Server which supports EIL.

P-model is the most recommended and close to the ECS.

### I-Model: ISP Recursive Resolver

ISP Recursive Resolver only serves its customers, each of whom has a static geolocation.
ISP Recursive Resolver can add EIL transparent to end user, 
and then Authoritative Server doesn't need to "guess geolocation of client’s IP".

EIL will be benefit if the Authoritative Server could not find the
approximate geolocation of ISP Recursive Resolver, which is crucial
to DNS response accuracy in ECS.

### L-Model: Local Forwarding Resolver

Local Forwarding Resolver is usually on the first-hop router, 
such as public Wi-Fi hotspot routers and Cisco/Linksys/Netgear/TP-LINK home routers.

When a Local Forwarding Resolver that implements EIL receives a DNS query from an end 
user, it surely can know about the geolocation information 
of client’s IP, and generate the EIL OPT data, then send 
the EIL query to the intermediate Recursive Resolver.
Intermediate Recursive Resolver sends the EIL query to the Authoritative Server.

In this scenario, both public Recursive Resolver and Authoritative
Server don't need to "guess geolocation of client's IP", because the
Local Forwarding Resolver supplies the geolocation precisely.  That
is, EIL can reduce dependence on the IP geolocation database quality,
which is crucial to DNS response accuracy in ECS.

If a Local Fowarding Resolver had sent a query with EIL, and recieves a REFUSE response, it MUST regenerate a query with no EIL.

## Generating a Response

### Whitelist

EIL contains a whitelist for COUNTRY-CODE, AREA-CODE and ISP, which
can be discussed or maintained by the DNSOP working group.
Authoritative Servers that supporting EIL must only response the EIL
queries matched the whitelist.  Recursive Resolver that supporting
EIL must only cache the EIL responses matched the whitelist.

### Authoritative Server

Using the isp location specified in the EIL option of dns query, an Authoritative Server can generate a tailored response.

Authoritative Servers that have not implemented or enabled support for the EIL ought to safely ignore it within incoming queries, response the query as a normal case without EDNS0 option. Such a server MUST NOT include an EIL option within replies to indicate lack of support for it.

An Authoritative Server that has implemented this protocol and receives an EIL option MUST include an EIL option in its response to indicate that it SHOULD be cached accordingly.

An Authoritative Server will return a more appropriate tailored response for the query with an EIL option containing more pricisely AREA-CODE.

### Intermediate Nameserver

  Like ECS, Intermediate Nameserver passes a dns response with an EIL option to its client when the client indicates support EIL.

  If an Intermediate Nameserver receives a response that has a larger area than the AREA-CODE provided in its query, it SHOULD still provide the result as the answer to the triggering client request even if the client is in a smaller area.

## Handling EIL Responses and Caching

If an Intermediate Nameserver had sent a query with EIL, and receives a NOERROR response without EIL option, it SHOULD treat this answer as suitable for all clients.

Other handling considerations are similar with ECS, SECTION 7.3.

### Caching the Response

In the cache, all resource records in the Answer section MUST be tied to the isp location specified in the response. The Answer seciton is valid for all areas which the EIL option covered. For example, an EIL option { "COUNTRY-CODE": "CN", "AREA-CODE": "35", "ISP": "TEL" } covers all 9 Cities in FuJian Province of China Telecommunications ISP.

Same with ECS, The Additional and Authority sections are excluded.

Enabling support for EIL in an Intermediate Nameserver will increase the size of the cache, and prevent "client subnet leak" privacy concern of ECS.

### Answering from Cache

   Cache lookups are first done as usual for a DNS query, using the query tuple of < name, type, class >. Then, the appropriate RRset MUST be chosen based on the isp location matching.

If there was an EIL option, the Intermediate Nameserver will lookup
for < same COUNTRY-CODE, same ISP, same AREA-CODE > of the same query
tuple in the cache.  Otherwise, try to find < same COUNTRY-CODE, same
ISP, same AREA-CODE > of the same query tuple in the cache.

   If no EIL option was provided, the safest choice of the Intermediate Nameserver is dealing the query as a normal case without EDNS0 option.

   If no EIL option was provided,  but the Intermediate Nameserver want to be more aggressive, it can guess the isp location from the souce IP of the query, then respond as if there was an EIL option with the guessed information.
   Users can be benefit when the Intermediate Nameserver has a more precise IP location database than the Authoritative Server, especially in global public DNS service like GoogleDNS(8.8.8.8).

   If no matching is found, the Intermediate Nameserver MUST perform resolution as usual.

### Support ECS and EIL at the same time

Name servers can support ECS and EIL at the same time.
ECS and EIL can’t be both initiated at the same dns packet.
It is better for user privacy if name servers initiate the EIL query prior to the ECS query.

If Authoritative  servers  support  both  ECS and  EIL, Recursive  resolvers  can  cache  both  ECS 
response and EIL response, there are some choices for Recursive Resolvers when they receive dns queries.

    Receive EIL query: 
        Search in EIL cache.
        If cache is matched, return EIL response.
        Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Server.

    Receive ECS query: 
        Search in ECS cache.
        If cache is matched, return ECS response.
        Otherwise, send ECS query to Authoritative Server.

    Receive DNS query without EDNS option: 
        Search in ECS cache.
        If cache is matched, return ECS response.
        Otherwise,  
            Guess the geolocation information of the client's IP, 
            build EIL option for the query packet.
            Search in EIL cache.
            If cache is matched, return EIL response.
            Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Server.

    Receive DNS query with not-ECS/not-EIL option: 
        Search in not-EDNS cache.
        If cache is matched, return response.
        Otherwise, send the DNS query to Authoritative Server.

    Receive ECS query, improve user privacy: 
        Guess the geolocation information of the client's IP, 
        build EIL option for the query packet.
        Search in EIL cache.
        If cache is matched, return EIL response RR with origin ECS option.
        Otherwise, send EIL query to Authoritative Server.

## Delegations and Negative Answers

  EIL's delegation case is similar with ECS, Additional and Authority Sections SHOULD ignore EIL.

  For negative answers, Authoritative Servers return traditional negative answers without EIL.

## Transitivity
    
  EIL's transitivity concerns are similar with ECS.

  Name servers should only enable EIL where it is expected to benefit the end users, 
such as dealing with some latency-sensitive CDN domain queries in a complex network environment.


# Security Considerations

## DNSSEC

EIL is not signed.

## Privacy

The biggest privacy concern on ECS is that client subnet information is personally identifiable. The more 
domains publish their zones on a third-party Authoritative Server, the more end user privacy information can be 
gathered by the Authoritative Server according to the ECS queries.

EIL is to improve user privacy which is inspired by ECS, prevented leaks in the client subnet information.

Like ECS, EIL will leak the global zonefile configurations of the Authoritative Servers more easily than normal case.

## Target Censorship 

 DNS traffic is plain text by default. It is easily to be 
blocked  or  poisoned  by  internet  target  censorship.  To 
bypass the censorship, it is better to encrypt the dns traffic 
or use some proxy tunnel.

  EIL’s geolocation information covers bigger area than 
ECS’s client subnet information. Therefore, compared to 
ECS  in  plain  text  condition,  EIL  is  weaker  at  blocking 
record  attack,  but  stronger  at  targeted  DNS  poisoning 
attack.

## Cache Size

Like  ECS,  cache  size  will  raise  if  a  public  recursive 
resolver supports EIL. The cache size of ECS grows up 
with the number of client subnets. The cache size of EIL 
is  related  to the  row count in  the < COUNTRY-CODE, AREA-CODE, 
ISP >  geolocation  whitelist.  Therefore,  under  IPv6 
environment, the cache size of EIL will be smaller than 
ECS.

## DDoS

To migrate the DDoS problem:

   *  If an Authority Server receives a dns query with unknown data in EIL option, it SHOULD return the default response whose EIL option with null value.

   *  Nameservers OPTIONAL only implement EIL when the query is from a TCP connection.

More migration techniques described in [](#RFC7871), Section 11.3.

# IANA Considerations

   This document defines EIL, need request IANA to assign a new EDNS0 option code to EIL.

# Acknowledgements

   EIL is inspired by ECS, the authors especially thanks to C. Contavalli, W. van der Gaast, D. Lawrence, and W. Kumari.

   Thanks a lot to all in the DNSOP, DNSPRIV and DNSEXT mailing list.

# Appendix A. Example

Authoritative Server of www.example.com has enabled EIL.

Stub DNS query A resource record of www.example.com .

## Example 1: P-Model

Stub DNS -> Local Forwarding Resolver (61.48.7.2) -> Public Forwarding Resolver(AliDNS, 223.5.5.5) -> Public Recursive Resolver(AliDNS, 202.108.250.231) -> Authoritative Server

Public Forwarding Resolver 223.5.5.5 could enable EIL and generate the EIL OPT data { "COUNTRY-CODE": "CN", "AREA-CODE": "11", "ISP": "UNI" } based on 61.48.7.2.

P-Model will not leak client subnet to Authoritative Server.

## Example 2: I-Model

Stub DNS -> Local Forwarding Resolver -> ISP Forwarding Resolver(202.106.196.115) -> ISP Recursive Resolver(61.135.23.92) -> Authoritative Server

ISP Recursive Resolver 61.135.23.92 could enable EIL and generate the EIL OPT data { "COUNTRY-CODE": "CN", "AREA-CODE": "11", "ISP": "UNI" } based on 61.135.23.92.

If Authoritative Server doesn't know much about 61.135.23.92, EIL will be helpful.

## Example 3: L-Model

Stub DNS -> Local Fowarding Resolver(58.60.109.234) -> ... -> Authoritative Server

Local Fowarding Resolver 58.60.109.234 could enable EIL and generate the option data is { "COUNTRY-CODE": "CN", "AREA-CODE": "44", "ISP": "TEL" } based on 58.60.109.234.

L-Model can give the most precisely isp location information for dns resolution.
