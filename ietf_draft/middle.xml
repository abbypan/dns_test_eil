  Introduction
  
    Nowadays, many authoritative nameservers support GeoIP feature, such
    as ,
    ,
    ,
    ,
    ,
     (More details are
    given in Appendix A). These geographically aware authoritative
    nameservers guess the user’s geolocation by the client subnet of ECS
    or by the source IP address of DNS query, return tailor DNS response
    based on the user’s geolocation.
  
  
    ECS is an EDNS0 option, described in
    , carries client subnet information
    in DNS queries for authoritative nameserver. Compared to source IP
    address of DNS query, ECS will help authoritative nameserver to
    guess the client’s location more precisely because of the DNS
    forwarding query structure.
  
  
    GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameservers use ECS for user geolocation
    detecting. However, ECS raises some privacy concerns because it
    leaks client subnet information on the resolution path to the
    authoritative nameserver.
  
  
    This document describes an improved solution for GeoIP-enabled
    authoritative nameserver, defines an EDNS ISP Location (EIL)
    extension to address the privacy problem of ECS, tries to find the
    right balance between privacy improvement and user experience
    optimization.
  
  
    EIL is defined to convey isp location &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt;
    information that is relevant to the DNS message. It will directly
    provide the same sufficient information for the GeoIP-enabled
    authoritative nameserver as ECS, to decide the response without
    guessing geolocation of the IP address.
  
  
    EIL is intended for those local forwarding resolvers, recursive
    resolvers and authoritative nameservers that would benefit from the
    extension and not for general purpose deployment. It could be
    applied for tailor DNS response like ECS scenario. EIL can safely be
    ignored by servers that choose not to implement or enable it.
  
  
    Path Calculation and Tailored DNS Response
    
      Separate the consideration of path calculation (data provider) and
      tailored DNS response (authoritative nameserver).
    
    
      Data providers make path calculations to optimize content delivery
      on the Internet based on the network topology, considering many
      factors such as IP, RIPs, FIBs, AS Path hops, system load, content
      availability, path latency, etc. Note that, data providers have
      the full details of the clients, they can make any complex path
      calculations without ECS and EIL.
    
    
      authoritative nameservers configure tailored DNS response based on
      the result of path calculations, allocate IP addresses to
      different datacenters, each IP address serves many client subnets.
      Usually, users from the same &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; isp
      location are allocated to the same datacenter, the same best
      network topologically close datacenter. For
      example, client IP addresses from &lt; China, Beijing, Telecom
      &gt; are allocated to DataCenter-1, client IP addresses from &lt;
      China, Beijing, Unicom &gt; are allocated to DataCenter-2, etc.
      Above is the GeoIP-based Tailored DNS Response.
    
    
      Therefore, if the GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameservers support
      ECS, they can use the client subnet information of ECS instead of
      resolver’s address for geolocation detecting. Alternative, the
      GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameservers can directly use the &lt;
      COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; information of EIL without geolocation
      detecting.
    
    
      Again, we emphasize that tailored DNS response does not affect
      path calculation. Data Providers can make path calculations based
      on network topology, decide network topological close datacenter
      for each IP address. authoritative nameservers allocate tailored
      DNS response to each IP address based on the network
      topological close result of path calculations. EIL tell
      authoritative nameserver like that, I want to know what is
      best IP address for clients from &lt; China, Beijing, Telecom &gt;
      at network topology path calculations result, but not
      I want to know what is the nearest IP address for clients
      from &lt; China, Beijing, Telecom &gt; at physical topology path
      calculations result.
    
    
      EIL is satisfied if authoritative nameservers aggregate the IP
      addresses from the same &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; isp location
      to visit the same datacenters, we call that GeoIP-based tailored
      DNS responses, and these tailored responses have the best
      network topological close distance to the users
      which are generated from network topology path calculations
      result.
    
    
      ECS is satisfied if authoritative nameservers make tailored DNS
      response down to subnet precise level. For example, (subnet-1, …,
      subnet-100) are from the same &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; isp
      location, Data Provider applies (subnet-1, …, subnet-50) visit
      DataCenter-1, (subnet-51, …, subnet-100) visit DataCenter-2.
    
  


  Problem of ECS
  
    As mentioned in ’s abstract section,
    since ECS has some known operational and privacy shortcomings, a
    revision will be worked through the IETF for improvement.
  
  
    Client
    
      Common users have little power to defense passive monitoring,
      expecially in the plain-text traffic.
    
    
      ECS’s client subnet leakage has rise some user privacy concerns.
    
  
  
    Recursive Resolver
    
      Recursive Resolver must deal with ECS’s cache problem, such as low
      cache hitrate, rise response time, redundant cache size, etc.
    
    
      Mukund Sivaraman described some scenarios in
      .
    
    
      ECS is precise because it is based on client subnet. But IPv6
      addresses will boom, we can foresee it to increase more burden on
      global recursive resolvers.
    
  
  
    GeoIP-enabled Authoritative Nameserver
    
      Resolver’s IP can on behalf of many client subnets if they are
      topological close. But this scenario has been varied by public
      recursive resolver. ECS push client subnets to authoritative
      nameserver, wants to solve the public recursive resolver’s
      IP is topological far from client subnet problem.
    
    
      However, ECS rises GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameserver’s
      dependence on IP2Geo database quality.
    
    
      Many GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameserver, most of the time, use
      &lt;COUNTRY, AREA, ISP&gt; information to decide the tailored
      response. Every GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameserver must
      operate IP2Geo database carefully and catch up with topology
      change. The work is inevitable, but ECS aggravate this, because
      the number of client subnets is far greater than the number of
      recursive resolvers.
    
    
      GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameserver needs a more precise IP2Geo
      database, updates it more frequent than before, to catch up with
      the huge client subnet network topology, but not the dns
      resolver’s IP network topology. Every GeoIP-enabled authoritative
      nameserver should cost more on IP2Geo database.

    which receives DNS queries from stub resolver, usually deployed
    nearby the first-hop router such as public Wi-Fi hotspot routers and
    home routers.
  
  
    Recursive Resolver: described in . It
    is the last-hop before authoritative nameserver in the DNS query
    path.
  
  
    Intermediate Nameserver: described in

    the local forwarding resolver and recursive resolver.
  
  
    authoritative nameserver: described in
     and .
    It is a server that knows the content of a DNS zone from local
    knowledge, and thus can answer queries about that zone without
    needing to query other servers.
  


  Overview
  
    EIL is an EDNS0 option to allow local forwarding resolvers and
    recursive resolvers, if they are willing, to forward details about
    the isp location of client when talking to other nameservers. EIL
    can be added in queries sent by local forwarding resolvers or
    recursive resolvers in a way that is transparent to Stub Resolvers
    and end users.
  
  
    Like ECS, authoritative nameservers could provide a better answer by
    using precise isp location in EIL. Intermediate Nameservers could
    send EIL query and cache the EIL response. This document also
    provides a mechanism to signal Intermediate Nameservers that they do
    not want EIL treatment for specific queries.
  
  
    EIL is only defined for the Internet (IN) DNS class.
  
  
    The format of EIL option is described in Section 5.
  
  
    The security concerns for EIL are like ECS, such as cache growth,
    spoof EDNS0 option and privacy, etc. Mitigation techniques are
    discussed in Section 6.
  


  The EIL EDNS0 option
  
    The EIL is an EDNS0 option to include the isp location of client in
    DNS messages.
  
  
    It is 16 octets which is structured as follows:
  
  
                +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)

      |                                                               |

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

      Total: 16 octets.

  
    
      
        OPTION-CODE, 2 octets, defined in
        . EDNS option code should be
        assigned by the IANA.
      
    
    
      
        OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets, defined in
        , contains the length of the
        payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in octets.
      
    
    
      
        COUNTRY, 2 octets, uppercase, defined in
        , indicates the country
        information of the client’s IP. For example, China’s COUNTRY is
        CN.
      
    
    
      
        AREA, 6 octets, uppercase, defined in
         country subdivision code,
        indicates the area information of the client’s IP. For example,
        The AREA of Fujian Province in China is 35.
      
    
    
      
        ISP, 4 octets, uppercase, indicates the ISP information of the
        client’s IP, using shortcut names. ISP shortcut names are unique
        within the context of the COUNTRY. For example, the shortcut
        name of China Telecommunications Corporation is TEL, the
        shortcut name of China United Network Communications is UNI, the
        shortcut name of China Mobile is MOB, etc.
      
    
  
  
    All fields are in network byte order (big-endian, per
    , Data Notation).
  
  
    The aim to use short names in the fields is to limit the data size
    of EIL, decrease the DDoS risk.
  
  
    The null value 0x20 signifies that the field is unknown. If all
    fields in EIL are set to null value, it means that client doesn’t
    want to use EIL.
  
  
    authoritative nameservers can send EIL response with the * value
    0x2A in AREA field or ISP field (not COUNTRY field), which signifies
    that the field is wildcard match. For example, &lt; CN, *, TEL &gt;
    indicates all area in China, Telecom ISP.

  Protocol Description
  
    Originating the Option
    
      The EIL can be initialized by Public recursive resolver, ISP
      recursive resolver, or local forwarding resolver.
    
    
      Examples are given in Appendix C.
    
    
      P-Model: Public recursive resolver
      
        Public recursive resolvers are not close to many users because
        the service providers couldn’t deploy servers in every country
        and every ISP’s network, which will affect the response accuracy
        of authoritative nameservers. To encounter this problem, ECS
        shifts the client subnet information to authoritative
        nameserver, but rises user privacy concerns.
      
      
        Therefore, to keep balance between precise and privacy, when a
        Public recursive resolver receives a DNS query, it can guess isp
        location of client’s IP and generate the EIL OPT data, then send
        EIL query to the authoritative nameserver. This will move the
        guess location of client’s IP work from
        authoritative nameserver back to Public recursive resolver,
        lighten the burden of authoritative nameserver, but increase
        DDoS risk on Public recursive resolver.
      
      
        In order to improve the user’s privacy, if a recursive resolver
        receives a DNS query with ECS, it can guess the isp location of
        SOURCE-PREFIX from the ECS OPT data, and make a new DNS query
        with EIL, then send the query to authoritative nameserver which
        supports EIL.
      
      
        P-model is the most recommended and close to the ECS.
      
    
    
      I-Model: ISP recursive resolver
      
        ISP recursive resolver only serves its customers, each of whom
        has a static isp location. ISP recursive resolver can add EIL
        transparent to end user, and then authoritative nameserver
        doesn’t need to guess location of client’s IP.
      
      
        EIL will be benefit if the authoritative nameserver could not
        find the approximate isp location of ISP recursive resolver,
        which is crucial to DNS response accuracy in ECS.
      
    
    
      L-Model: local forwarding resolver
      
        local forwarding resolver is usually on the first-hop router,
        such as public Wi-Fi hotspot routers and
        Cisco/Linksys/Netgear/TP-LINK home routers.
      
      
        When a local forwarding resolver that implements EIL receives a
        DNS query from an end user, it surely can know about the isp
        location of client’s IP, and generate the EIL OPT data, then
        send the EIL query to the intermediate recursive resolver.
        Intermediate recursive resolver sends the EIL query to the
        authoritative nameserver.
      
      
        In this scenario, both Public recursive resolver and
        authoritative nameserver don’t need to guess location of
        client’s IP, because the local forwarding resolver
        supplies the isp location precisely. That is, EIL can reduce
        dependence on the IP geolocation database quality, which is
        crucial to DNS response accuracy in ECS.
      
      
        If a local forwarding resolver had sent a query with EIL, and
        receives a REFUSE response, it MUST regenerate a query with no
        EIL.
      
    
  
  
    Generating a Response
    
      Whitelist
      
        EIL contains a whitelist for COUNTRY, AREA and ISP, which can be
        discussed and maintained by the DNSOP working group.
        authoritative nameservers that supporting EIL must only response
        the EIL queries matched the whitelist. recursive resolver that
        supporting EIL must only cache the EIL responses matched the
        whitelist.
      
    
    
      authoritative nameserver
      
        Using the isp location specified in the EIL option of DNS query,
        an authoritative nameserver can generate a tailored response.
      
      
        authoritative nameservers that have not implemented or enabled
        support for the EIL ought to safely ignore it within incoming
        queries, response the query as a normal case without EDNS0
        option. Such a server MUST NOT include an EIL option within
        replies to indicate lack of support for it.
      
      
        An authoritative nameserver that has implemented this protocol
        and receives an EIL option MUST include an EIL option in its
        response to indicate that it SHOULD be cached accordingly.
      
      
        An authoritative nameserver will return a more appropriate
        tailored response for the query with an EIL option containing
        more precisely AREA.
      
    
    
      Intermediate Nameserver
      
        Like ECS, Intermediate Nameserver passes a DNS response with an
        EIL option to its client when the client indicates support EIL.
      
      
        If an Intermediate Nameserver receives a response that has a
        larger area than the AREA provided in its query, it SHOULD still
        provide the result as the answer to the triggering client
        request even if the client is in a smaller area.
      
    
  
  
    Handling EIL Responses and Caching
    
      If an Intermediate Nameserver had sent a query with EIL, and
      receives a NOERROR response without EIL option, it SHOULD treat
      this answer as suitable for all clients.
    
    
      Other handling considerations are similar with
      ECS, SECTION 7.3.
    
    
      In the cache, all resource records in the Answer section MUST be
      tied to the isp location specified in the response. The Answer
      section is valid for all areas which the EIL option covered. For
      example, an EIL option &lt; CN, 35, TEL &gt; covers all 9 Cities
      in Fujian Province of China Telecommunications ISP.
    
    
      Same with ECS, The Additional and Authority sections are excluded.
    
    
      Enabling support for EIL in an Intermediate Nameserver will
      increase the size of the cache, and prevent client subnet
      leak privacy concern of ECS.
    
    
      Answering from Cache
      
        Cache lookups are first done as usual for a DNS query, using the
        query tuple of &lt; name, type, class &gt;. Then, the
        appropriate RRset MUST be chosen based on the isp location
        matching.
      
      
        If there was an EIL option, the Intermediate Nameserver will
        lookup for &lt; same COUNTRY, same ISP, same AREA &gt; of the
        same query tuple in the cache. Otherwise, try to find &lt; same
        COUNTRY, same ISP, same AREA &gt; of the same query tuple in the
        cache.
      
      
        If no EIL option was provided, the safest choice of the
        Intermediate Nameserver is dealing the query as a normal case
        without EDNS0 option.
      
      
        If no EIL option was provided, but the Intermediate Nameserver
        want to be more aggressive, it can guess the isp location from
        the source IP of the query, then respond as if there was an EIL
        option with the guessed information. Users can be benefit when
        the Intermediate Nameserver has a more precise IP location
        database than the authoritative nameserver, especially in global
        public DNS service like GoogleDNS(8.8.8.8).
      
      
        If no matching is found, the Intermediate Nameserver MUST
        perform resolution as usual.
      
    
  
  
    Delegations and Negative Answers
    
      EIL’s delegation case is similar with ECS, Additional and
      Authority Sections SHOULD ignore EIL.
    
    
      For negative answers, authoritative nameservers return traditional
      negative answers without EIL.
    
  
  
    Transitivity
    
      EIL’s transitivity concerns are similar with ECS.
    
    
      Name servers should only enable EIL where it is expected to
      benefit the end users, such as dealing with some latency-sensitive
      CDN domain queries in a complex network environment.
    
  


  Compatibility with non-EDNS and ECS
  
    For realworld compatibility, EIL is designed as an additional
    feature to ECS. If a nameserver supports EIL, it must support ECS
    first. So there are three scenarios: non-EDNS, ECS but non-EIL, ECS
    and EIL.
  
  
    
      
        GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameservers map ECS’s client subnet
        into EIL’s geolocation to get tailor response, they can simply
        add EIL support. Some realtime client subnet sensitive CDN
        domains, such as Akamai, they may not support GeoIP feature and
        EIL.
      
    
    
      
        EIL-enabled recursive resolvers only send EIL queries to
        EIL-enabled authoritative nameservers. At the same time, they
        can also send ECS queries.
      
    
  
  
    The indicator that authoritative nameservers used to generate tailor
    response is showed as follows:
  
  
    +-------------------------+-----------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

    Support ECS and EIL at the same time
    
      Name servers can support ECS and EIL at the same time. ECS and EIL
      can’t be both initiated at the same DNS packet. It is better for
      user privacy if name servers initiate the EIL query prior to the
      ECS query.
    
    
      If authoritative nameservers support both ECS and EIL, recursive
      resolvers can cache both ECS response and EIL response, there are
      some choices for recursive resolvers when they receive DNS
      queries.
    
    
Receive EIL query: 
    Search in EIL cache.
    If cache is matched, return EIL response.
    Otherwise, send EIL query to authoritative nameserver.

Receive ECS query: 
    Search in ECS cache.
    If cache is matched, return ECS response.
    Otherwise, send ECS query to authoritative nameserver.

Receive DNS query without EDNS option: 
    Search in ECS cache.
    If cache is matched, return ECS response.
    Otherwise,  
        Guess the isp location information of the client's IP, 
        build EIL option for the query packet.
        Search in EIL cache.
        If cache is matched, return EIL response.
        Otherwise, send EIL query to authoritative nameserver.

Receive DNS query with not-ECS/not-EIL option: 
    Search in not-EDNS cache.
    If cache is matched, return response.
    Otherwise, send the DNS query to authoritative nameserver.

Receive ECS query, improve user privacy: 
    Guess the isp location information of the client's IP, 
    build EIL option for the query packet.
    Search in EIL cache.
    If cache is matched, return EIL response RR with origin ECS option.
    Otherwise, send EIL query to authoritative nameserver.

  
  
    Why not use AS number to build EIL
    
      AS number is not an ideal object to balance between response
      accuracy and user privacy, for example:
    
    
      
        
          AS24151 can directly guide to China Internet Network
          Infomation Center, it is not good for user privacy.
        
      
      
        
          AS4134 contains a huge amount of IP prefixes whose geolocation
          covers from South China to North China, AS number can not
          afford the response accuracy consideration.
        
      
    
  


  Benefit and Cost
  
    Cache Hitrate, Response Latency, and Cache Size
    
      ECS sends the query with client subnet, which means that recursive
      resolvers have to send a new query to authoritative nameservers
      with client_subnet_b, even it has known the response about
      topological close client_subnet_a. In fact, thousands of subnets
      visit only a few servers, there are many redundacy queries, the
      recursive’s cache hitrate is low.
    
    
      Because of ECS’s low cache hitrate, recursive servers’s ECS
      tailored response latency will be longer, the average of response
      time will rise with the redundacy queries rate from recursive
      resolvers to authoritative nameservers.
    
    
      Recursive’s ECS cache size grows up with the number of client
      subnets.
    
    
      To sum it up, above problems all rise with the client subnet
      amount, especially when IPv6 addresses boom. Extend the subnet
      range in the ECS response may be mitigating, but not work for wide
      range client subnets. Recursive can make some guess optimization,
      if it has known response for client_subnet_a, then guess to return
      the same response for toplogical close client_subnet_b without
      send the redundancy query.
    
    
      Therefore, if the ECS revision wants to make more effective client
      subnets aggregation for recursive resolver, then EIL can be an
      considerable choice. EIL wants to summary toplogical close client
      subnets into &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; for GeoIP-enabled
      authoritative nameserver. With EIL response cache, recursive
      resolvers can directly response for many ECS client subnets
      queries, which will rise cache hitrate and reduce response
      latency. The cache size of EIL is related to the row count in the
      &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; isp location whitelist. Therefore,
      under IPv6 environment, the cache size of EIL will be much smaller
      than ECS.
    
    
      Note that, the EIL mapping work make recursive resolver to cost
      more cpu.
    
  
  
    Response Accuracy Dependence
    
      Client subnet is the best factor if the company has good network
      topology monitor ability, offen is for big company. However, for
      many authoritative servers that only deployed GeoDNS, the accuracy
      limitation is commonly because of the IP2Geo database quality, and
      the small ISPs change to another next-hop big ISP suddenly.
    
    
      For the GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameserver, the response
      accurancy depends on the IP geolocation database quality. If
      authoritative nameserver can not find approximate isp location of
      ECS’s client subnet, they can not return best tailored response.
    
    
      Even though GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameservers know about the
      precise isp location of ECS’s client subnet, they may not know
      about the latest toplogical path change of the isp to update the
      tailored response in time. In the case of small ISP -&gt;
      big ISP (change frequency) -&gt; … -&gt; website, both
      small ISP’s client ip/resolver ip is not good factor for GeoDNS.
      Big companies work hard to catch up with the client ip’s connect
      topology change, and adjust their authoritative nameservers’
      tailored response, but smaller companies only deploy IP2Geo may
      not afford.
    
    
      EIL wants to give downstream a chance to tell authoritative
      nameserver its best path quickly and proactively, help to rise the
      response accuracy, avoid cross-isp visit, save IP transit cost for
      Data Provider. EIL directly provide sufficient information for the
      GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameserver. Compared to ECS, EIL can
      reduce GeoIP-enabled authoritative nameserver’s dependence on the
      IP geolocation database quality.
    
  


  Security Considerations
  
    DNSSEC
    
      EIL is not signed.
    
  
  
    Privacy
    
      The biggest privacy concern on ECS is that client subnet
      information is personally identifiable. The more domains publish
      their zones on a third-party authoritative nameserver, the more
      end user privacy information can be gathered by the authoritative
      nameserver according to the ECS queries.
    
    
      EIL is to improve user privacy which is inspired by ECS, prevented
      leaks in the client subnet information.
    
    
      Like ECS, EIL will leak the global zonefile configurations of the
      authoritative nameservers more easily than normal case.
    
  
  
    Target Censorship
    
      DNS traffic is plain text by default. It is easily to be blocked
      or poisoned by internet target censorship. To bypass the
      censorship, it is better to encrypt the DNS traffic or use some
      proxy tunnel.
    
    
      EIL’s isp location information covers bigger area than ECS’s
      client subnet information. Therefore, compared to ECS in plain
      text condition, EIL is weaker at blocking record attack, but
      stronger at targeted DNS poisoning attack.
    
  
  
    DDoS
    
      To migrate the DDoS problem:
    
    
      
        
          If an Authority Server receives a DNS query with unknown data
          in EIL option, it SHOULD return the default response whose EIL
          option with null value.
        
      
      
        
          Nameservers OPTIONAL only implement EIL when the query is from
          a TCP connection.
        
      
    
    
      More migration techniques described in
      , Section 11.3.
    
  


  IANA Considerations
  
    This document defines EIL, need request IANA to assign a new EDNS0
    option code to EIL.

  Appendix A. GeoIP-enabled Authoritative Nameservers
  Example
  
    BIND-GeoIP
    
      As described in , BIND 9.10 is
      able to use data from MaxMind GeoIP databases to achieve
      restrictions based on the (presumed) geographic location of that
      address. The ACL itself is still address-based, but the
      GeoIP-based specification mechanisms can easily populate an ACL
      with addresses in a certain geographic location.
    
    
acl "example" {
  geoip country US;
  geoip region CA;
  geoip city "Redwood City"; /* names, etc., must be quoted if they contain spaces */
};

  
  
    PowerDNS-GeoIP
    
      As described in , PowerDNS
      supports many geolocation placeholders, such as %co = 3-letter
      country, %cn = continent, %re = region, %ci = city.
    
    
domains:
- domain: geo.example.com
  ttl: 30
  records:
    geo.example.com:
      - soa: ns1.example.com hostmaster.example.com 2014090125 7200 3600 1209600 3600
      - ns:
           content: ns1.example.com
           ttl: 600
      - ns: ns2.example.com
      - mx: 10 mx.example.com
    fin.eu.service.geo.example.com:
      - a: 192.0.2.2
      - txt: hello world
      - aaaa: 2001:DB8::12:34DE:3
    # this will result first record being handed out 30% of time
    swe.eu.service.geo.example.com:
      - a:
           content: 192.0.2.3
           weight: 50
      - a: 192.0.2.4
  services:
    # syntax 1
    service.geo.example.com: '%co.%cn.service.geo.example.com'
    # syntax 2
    service.geo.example.com: [ '%co.%cn.service.geo.example.com', '%cn.service.geo.example.com']
    # alternative syntax
  services:
    service.geo.example.com:
      default: [ '%co.%cn.service.geo.example.com', '%cn.service.geo.example.com' ]
      10.0.0.0/8: 'internal.service.geo.example.com'

  
  
    Amazon-Geolocation-Routing
    
      As described in
      , Amazon Route
      53 lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on
      the geographic location of your users, meaning the location that
      DNS queries originate from. It allows you to route some queries
      for a continent to one resource and to route queries for selected
      countries on that continent to a different resource.
    
    
      When a browser or other viewer uses a DNS resolver that does
      support edns-client-subnet, the DNS resolver sends Amazon Route 53
      a truncated version of the user’s IP address. Amazon Route 53
      determines the location of the user based on the truncated IP
      address rather than the source IP address of the DNS resolver;
      this typically provides a more accurate estimate of the user’s
      location. Amazon Route 53 then responds to geolocation queries
      with the DNS record for the user’s location.
    
  
  
    DYN-Traffic-Director-ECS
    
      As described in
      
      and , Dyn provides
      the ability to control DNS responses on a granular/customized
      geographical rule set. Part of the rulesets will be the
      identification of the global regions, countries, or states and
      provinces that use a specific DNS server group. DYN uses the ECS
      information for the geolocation lookup. Once a geolocation is
      found and a response is selected, it will provide a DNS response
      back to the source IP address.
    
  
  
    gdnsd-GeoIP
    
      As described in , gdnsd uses
      MaxMind’s GeoIP binary databases to map address and CNAME results
      based on geography and monitored service availability. gdnsd
      supports geolocation codes, such as continent, country,
      region/subdivision, city.
    
  
  
    Windows-Server-GeoLocation
    
      As described in
      , Windows server
      can be configured DNS Policy to respond to DNS client queries
      based on the geographical location of both the client and the
      resource to which the client is attempting to connect, providing
      the client with the IP address of the closest resource.
    
  


  Appendix B. Frequent GeoIP-enabled Authoritative Nameserver’s
  Response Accuracy Problem
  
    Public Recursive Resolver with non-ECS authoritative
    nameserver
    
      If authoritative nameserver doesn’t support ECS, the clients that
      use public recursive resolver(such as 8.8.8.8) may receive
      disaster latency IP.
    
    
      In this scenario, we must pray that public recursive resolver’s IP
      is topological close to client’s IP.
    
  
  
    Unstable ISP network topology
    
      small ISP change their upstream frequently。
    
  


  Appendix C. EIL Example
  
    authoritative nameserver of www.example.com has enabled EIL.
  
  
    Stub DNS query A resource record of www.example.com .
  
  
    P-Model
    
Stub DNS 
-&gt; local forwarding resolver (61.48.7.2) 
-&gt; Public Forwarding Resolver(AliDNS, 223.5.5.5) 
-&gt; Public recursive resolver(AliDNS, 202.108.250.231) 
-&gt; authoritative nameserver

    
      Public Forwarding Resolver 223.5.5.5 could enable EIL and generate
      the EIL OPT data &lt; CN, 11, UNI &gt; based on 61.48.7.2.
    
    
      P-Model will not leak client subnet to authoritative nameserver.
    
  
  
    I-Model
    
Stub DNS

-&gt; ISP Forwarding Resolver(202.106.196.115) 
-&gt; ISP recursive resolver(61.135.23.92) 
-&gt; authoritative nameserver

    
      ISP recursive resolver 61.135.23.92 could enable EIL and generate
      the EIL OPT data &lt; CN, 11, UNI &gt; based on 61.135.23.92.
    
    
      If authoritative nameserver doesn’t know much about 61.135.23.92,
      EIL will be helpful.
    
  
  
    L-Model
    
Stub DNS

-&gt; ... 
-&gt; authoritative nameserver

    
      Local Fowarding Resolver 58.60.109.234 could enable EIL and
      generate the option data is &lt; CN, 44, TEL &gt; based on
      58.60.109.234.
    
    
      L-Model can give the most precisely isp location information for
      DNS resolution.
